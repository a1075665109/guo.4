Project 4

For this project, compile it by first enter the command "make"
It then creates an executable called "oss" and another called "user".
Running the project by calling "./oss".
It could also be ran with these command line arguments "-h -t".

-h: displays all the avaliable command line arguments for this project then runs the program.
-t: give a integer after -t to change the dafault running time of the main program from 3seconds to given integer seconds.


Some problems I ran into while programming that took a long time to solve:
        1. shared memory creation access through different exec commands
        2. implementing variables of different type (float,char,int) caused trouble when I wasn't careful with the format of printf/fprintf
        3. random number generator between difference process while they are generated super fastly.
	3. had huge trouble implementing the msg queue, program could not work with it so I decided to leave it out.
	 


Version control through github, all the logs could be found under log.txt within the directory.

make clean command will remove the executable and the default output file.
